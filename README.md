### About

Game Hub brings the simplicity of the classic OxygenOS 11 Game Space to modern Android devices. It eliminates the need to scroll through a messy app drawer to find your next adventure.

This app acts as a dedicated sanctuary for your games. It automatically detects installed games and presents them in a clean, unified interface. While it is designed with **Pixel and AOSP** aesthetics in priority, it functions seamlessly on any Android 8+ device.

### Design

The UI is crafted following the latest **Material 3 Expressive** guidelines.
