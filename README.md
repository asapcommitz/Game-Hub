This app is mainly inspired from OnePlus' Game Space from OxygenOS 11, that app didnt do anything special, just a shortcut to all your games and nothing much. That's what I've done with this app, now you don't have to search for a game icon in all your messy app drawer, every games' icon is right there, in Game Hub.

This is a very simple app and the main focus was to give a sort of game launcher in primis to Pixel and AOSP devices, but it can be used on any device.

This app is created following in the best way possible the Material 3 Expressive guidelines.
